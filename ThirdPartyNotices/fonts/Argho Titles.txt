MODIFICATIONS:

Subsets of characters in woff2 format are self-hosted, sourced via https://fonts.google.com/.

Used https://github.com/google/woff2 and https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools to modify the font
name metadata.

# For each <subset>: cyrillic-ext, cyrillic, latin-ext, latin, vietnamese:

# Download woff2 sources as lora-<subset>.woff2	as referenced by this Google Fonts CSS stylesheet:

woff2_decompress lora-<subset>.woff2
ttx -o argho-titles-<subset>.ttx lora-<subset>.ttf
# Edit argho-titles-<subset> with a text editor to replace instances of reserved font name
# Lora (while retaining it in notices of copyright, trademark, and license), since the
# OFL-1.1-RFN license requires any modifications (including subsetting) to be placed under a
# different font name.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
